# ApplySmart: AI-Powered Job Application Assistant

ApplySmart is a comprehensive, AI-powered job application management tool designed to streamline and accelerate the process of creating tailored resumes and personalized outreach emails. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), this tool automates the most time-consuming aspects of a job search, allowing you to focus on applying and interviewing.

## 1. Introduction

### Objective
- ApplySmart is a comprehensive, AI-powered job application management tool designed to streamline and accelerate the process of creating tailored resumes and personalized outreach emails. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), this tool automates the most time-consuming aspects of a job search, allowing you to focus on applying and interviewing.

- The core workflow revolves around creating "Resume Projects" for each job application. Within a project, you can save a job description, generate multiple AI-tailored versions of your resume, fine-tune the content and formatting with a live PDF preview, and finally, generate a personalized cold email for outreach.

### Disclaimer Regarding AI
- The content generated by the AI (summaries, bullet points, emails, etc.) is intended to be a powerful starting point. It is crucial to review, edit, and verify all generated text for accuracy, tone, and appropriateness before sending it to a potential employer. The AI is a creative assistant, not a replacement for your own judgment and professional voice.

### Disclaimer on Generalization
- This version of ApplySmart has been specifically configured for my personal resume data, prompt instructions, and contact information. While the tool is fully functional, it is not yet generalized for public use out-of-the-box. Customizing it for another user would require modifications to the base resume file (`base_resume_fixed.yaml`) and the AI prompts within the backend code (`app/backend/llm_services.py`).

## 2. Features
ApplySmart is organized into several tabs, each serving a distinct purpose in the job application lifecycle.

### 2.1 Application Management & Workflow (`Applications` Tab)
This is the central hub for creating and managing your resume projects.

#### <u>Project Creation:</u>

- Create a new, unique project for each job application by providing a Company Name and Role Title.
- Optionally include a Job ID and Job Link for tracking purposes.

#### <u>Project Navigation:</u>

- A searchable list of all your projects is available in the sidebar, sorted by creation date.
- The sidebar can be collapsed for a wider workspace.

#### <u>Resume Generation Workflow</u>
A 5-step process to take you from a job description to a finalized, tailored resume.
Applications
- **Step 1 - Job Description**: 
    - Paste the full job description (HTML or plain text) into the editor and save it. This provides the context for the AI.
- **Step 2 - Generate Resume**:
    - Choose your preferred AI model (Google Gemini or ChatGPT via OpenRouter).
    - Click `Generate New Version` to have the AI create a tailored summary, reorder your skills, and completely rewrite your experience and project bullet points to align with the job description.
    - Each generation creates a new `tailored_resume_v{X}.yaml` file within the project's folder, allowing for version control.
- **Step 3 - Select Content**:
    - Use the "Select Resume Version" dropdown to switch between different AI-generated versions or the final "locked-in" version.
    - A dynamic form with checkboxes allows you to include or exclude entire sections (like Certifications) or individual items (like a specific project or job experience) from the PDF preview.
    - Dropdowns let you quickly switch between pre-configured contact details (e.g., different emails or locations).
- **Step 4 - Formatting & Spacing:**
    - A live PDF preview updates in real-time as you make changes to content or formatting.
    - A comprehensive form allows you to tweak stylistic elements like font sizes, spacing between sections, and alignment.
    - You can load a custom formatting configuration from a YAML file, save your current settings, or reset to the application's defaults.
- **Step 5 - Finalize:**
    - The Finalize Resume button takes your currently selected content and formatting, saves it as a permanent `finalized_resume.yaml` and *Resume_{Your_Name}.pdf*, and locks it in.
    - The Track Application button (enabled after finalization) sends the application details directly to the Tracker tab.

#### <u>User Journey Example (`Applications` Tab)</u>

## 5. Customization Instructions
### 5.1 Base Resume (`base_resume_fixed.yaml`)

This file is the foundation of every resume you generate. It's crucial to fill it out completely and correctly.

- <u>**Structure**</u>: The file is in YAML format. Pay close attention to indentation.
- <u>**name and contact**</u>: Fill in your personal details. These are used to populate the header of the resume.
- <u>**education**</u>: List your degrees. The courses field is a single string of comma-separated course names.
- <u>**skills**</u>: This is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a skill category (e.g., Languages, ML_Techniques). The value is a list of skills in that category. The AI will reorder these categories and the skills within them based on the job description.
- <u>**experience and projects**</u>: For these sections, the context field is key. It's a short, 1-2 sentence summary of your role or project. The AI uses this context as a creative "seed" to invent the detailed, quantified, PAR-framework bullet points. You do not need to write full bullet points here.
- <u>**certifications**</u>: List any relevant certifications. The description is a list of bullet points.

### 5.2 AI Prompting (`app/backend/llm_services.py`)

The logic for the AI is located in the agent_resume_tailor function. You can customize its behavior by editing the prompt string within this function.

#### <u>Changing Bullet Point Counts</u>:
- Find the section in the prompt labeled Number of Bullets. You can change the integer values to control how many points are generated for each job experience.

- *Example from the prompt:*
    ```yaml
    - Number of Bullets:
        - DRINKS: 4 points  # Change this to 3 to get 3 bullets
        - AB INBEV: 8 points
        - Janta Ka Mood: 2 points
    ```
#### <u>Changing Word/Character Limits</u>:

- The prompt contains strict instructions like `make the entire line is 135 characters. strict.` 
- You can find and modify these numerical values to adjust the length of the generated summary and bullet points.

#### <u>Changing Project Bullet Point Count</u>:

- The prompt for projects_reordered specifies `Only 2 bullets per project.` 
- You can change this number to get more or fewer bullets for your projects.

#### <u>Default PDF Styling (`app/backend/variables.yaml`)</u>:
- This file controls the default visual styling of the PDF output. 
- You can change font sizes, spacing, and the base font family (Times-Roman, Helvetica, or Courier) here without needing to touch the code.
- These values populate the `Formatting & Spacing` form in the UI, and any changes you make in the UI for a specific project will override these defaults.

### 5.3 Backend API Enhancements
- **Cover Letter Preview API**: New endpoint `/applications/{app_id}/render-cover-letter-preview` for live preview generation
- **Cover Letter Details API**: New endpoint `/applications/{app_id}/save-cover-letter-details` for saving email and additional details
- **Enhanced PDF Generation**: Improved cover letter PDF generation with dynamic contact information
- **Timestamp Synchronization**: Automatic file system timestamp updates for consistent "last updated" tracking
